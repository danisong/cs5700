    "A SAT solver takes as input a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and returns one of two answers: SAT, if the formula is satisfiable, or UNSAT, if it is unsatisfiable.  If the answer is SAT the solver will furthermore return a satisfying assignment.  SAT is an example of an NP-complete problem (in, fact it was the first problem class discovered to be NP-complete!), and thus the best algorithms require time exponential in the number of propositional symbols in the worst case.  Quite surprisingly, SAT solvers can nonetheless produce an answer for a formula with over a million variables in seconds. As a result SAT solvers have become the \"go to\" tool for solving NP-hard problems in the absence of known problem-specific heuristics, and they have made a large impact on the real world in areas such as hardware design verification, scheduling problems, and automatic theorem proving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a SAT solver on a given problem requires converting the problem into an equivalent propositional satisfiability question, solving the SAT question, and then converting the answer back to the terms in which the original problem was posed.  The goal of this exercise is to give you some experience with SAT solvers, both in encoding a problem as a SAT question, and to get a sense of its efficiency.

    "In this example, we first initialized a solver object whose backend is MiniSAT and added two clauses. Recall from lecture that a literal is either a propositional symbol or its negation, and a clause is a disjunction of literals. Here, literals are represented by integers; a postive integer represents an unnegated propositional symbol, and a negative integer represents the negation of a propositional symbol. Thus, for example, the integer +2 could be thought of as representing a propositional symbol $P_2$ and the integer -1 as representing $\\neg P_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a clause is represented as a list of literals (positive and negative integers). Thus for example, ``solver.add_clause([-1, 2])`` adds the clause equivalent to $(\\neg P_1 \\vee P_2)$. Note that rather than referring to the propositional symbols as symbols such as $P_2$, we’ll typically use the integer 2 itself to refer to the corresponding propositional symbol.  Note that you don't need to “declare” the propositional variables with PySAT; simply adding a clause that uses a particular integer for the first time is sufficient for the system to understand that the integer represents a new propositional symbol.  The set of clauses added in this fashion are taken as being conjoined together, thereby defining the propositional sentence to be tested by the SAT solver.  Checking the satisfiability of the created CNF formula is done using ``solver.solve()``; if it is satisfiable, ``solver.get_model()`` returns a truth assignment that satisfies the formula. We'll be using the ``.add_clause()``, ``.solve()``, and ``.get_model()`` methods a lot later in this exercise."

    "First, we will go through a brief tutorial on how to encode a problem using SAT. Encoding a problem with SAT typically involves answering two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   What are the propositional symbols?\n",
    "2.   How can we write down propositional sentences that reflect the constraints that the problem places on those propositional symbols?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a second and think about these two questions for a minesweeper puzzle. A minesweeper puzzle is based on a computer puzzle game that is installed by default in MS Windows, and also available for most other operating systems. There are mines hidden in the square; you need to find them. Every number says how many cells around it contain mines. Its decision problem -- does the solution exist? -- is NP-complete. To encode this decision problem using SAT, a propositional formula should be built as equivalent to a minesweeper puzzle's decision problem in the sense that every satisfying assignment corresponds to a solution to the minesweeper puzzle, and vice versa. How do we create this one-to-one mapping?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of translating a minesweeper puzzle into a SAT problem. Here is one example. To answer question #1, let’s create one propositional symbols for each sqaure $(i,j)$, indicating the existence of mines at that location.  To refer to these symbols we’ll use the notation $v_{(i, j)}$, which is the propositional symbol that represents that a mine is placed in location $(i,j)$. It is true if a mine is in location $(i,j)$ – in other words, $v_{(i,j)}=true$ if and only if a mine is in square $(i,j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, how do we represent these propositional symbols in a SAT solver? We create two mappings: in the example above, we use $v_{(i, j)}$ to represent the propositional symbol corresponding to location $(i, j)$; however, in an actual Python implementation clauses are written in integers (remember we call ``.add_clause([-1, 2])`` to add clause $(\\neg P_1 \\vee P_2)$. Therefore, we need a mechanism to keep track of the relations between variable integers in the SAT solver and propositional symbols associated with each square. We thus create two mappings, one from a propositional symbol representing square $(i, j)$ to a variable integer in the SAT solver, and the other from the variable integer in SAT solver back to the square $(i, j)$. In this way, we are able to keep track of what each variable integer in the solver means. We do this in the following code snippet:\n"

    "The second question is to formulate propositional sentences that represent the constraints that define a legal solution to a minesweeper problem so that the resulting SAT assignment corresponds to a minesweeper solution.  The nature of minesweeper problems suggests constrains on the number of mines around each visible number. We first decompose the constrain -- exactly $k$ literals are true among $m$ literals, i.e., $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m = k$ -- into two parts: (1) *at least* $k$ literals are true among $m$ literals, i.e., $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m \\ge k$ and (2) *at most* $k$ literals are true among $m$ literals, i.e., $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m \\le k$. Noticing that $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m \\le k$ is equivalent to $\\neg x_1 + \\neg  x_2 + \\cdots + \\neg x_m \\ge m-k$, we then mainly focus on how to represent the at-least constrain, i.e., $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m \\ge k$, in CNF. As discussed in [this article](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume21/dixon04a-html/node14.html), it  is easy to prove that $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_m \\ge k$ is logically equivalent to the set of $m \\choose {m-k+1}$ axioms \n",
    "$$x_{i_1} + x_{i_2} + \\cdots + x_{i_{m-k+1}} \\ge 1.$$\n",
    "Inuitively, if at least $k$ literals (formulating a set $S_k$) are true among $m$ literals (formulating a set $S_m$ and $S_k\\subseteq S_m$), for any choice of $m-k+1$ literals (formulating a set $S_{m-k+1}\\subseteq S_m$), there is at least one literal to be true since $S_{m-k+1}\\cap S_k\\neq \\emptyset$. On the other contrary, if the number of true literals is less than $k$ among $m$ literals, there must exist a choice of $m-k+1$ literals such that all of them are false. Here is how we can write up some code to represent these as a sentence in CNF."
